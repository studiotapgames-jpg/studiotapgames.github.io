Privacy Policy
Last updated: November 6, 2025

Balloon Survival (“the App”) is a free, casual game developed for entertainment purposes. This Privacy Policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your rights as a user.

1. No Personal Data Collected
The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users, including children. There is no login, no signup, and no access to personal files, contacts, location, or device identifiers.

2. Use of Third-Party Advertising
The App uses Google AdMob to display non-personalized ads. These ads may use anonymized data (such as coarse location or device type) to show relevant content, but no personally identifiable information is collected or shared.

As required by Google, this App is marked as directed to children under 13, and ad personalization is disabled in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

3. Analytics for App Improvement
The App uses Firebase Analytics in anonymized mode to understand general usage patterns (e.g., how many people play, how long they play). No user-level data is tracked, and all data is aggregated and anonymous. You can opt out of Firebase Analytics by uninstalling the App.

4. No Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties, except for:

Google (for AdMob and Firebase, as described above)
Google Play Services (for basic app functionality)
5. Changes to This Policy
If we ever update this Privacy Policy, we will post the new version in the App’s store listing.
